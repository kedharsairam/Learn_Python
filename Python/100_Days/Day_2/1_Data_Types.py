#String

#These are set of characters which are strung together and we have to create them with quotes around them.
#Ex:"Hello"
print("Hello"[4])
#for pulling out each character individually.
#the number denotes the position of the character.
#it's starts with "0" and so on...
print("123" + "456")
#this is also a string, so it doesn't calculate or consider this as numbers.


#Integer

#for writing numbers, just write the number without any quotes.
#all numbers are called integers, no matter if it is positive or negative.
print(123 + 456)
#by this we can simply calculate the numbers.
print(123_456_789)
#for separating large numbers we simply put underscore. and the program will not gonna effect. but this is just for our convenience only.


#Float

#numbers with decimal places are called a float.
3.141592654


#Boolean

#It only has two possible values "True" and "False", and it is always started with capital letter.
# these are also used without quotes.
True
False
#these are used to find something is true or false and run the program accordingly.
